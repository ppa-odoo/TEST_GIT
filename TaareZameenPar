Main Kabhi Batlata Nahin
Though I've never told you


Par Andhere Se Darta Hoon Main Maa
But I'am afraid of darkness mom


Yun To Main Dikhlata Nahin
Though I've never shown it


Teri Parwaah Karta Hoon Main Maa
I do care for you mom


Tujhe Sab Hain Pata Hain Na Maa
Aren't you aware of everything mom


Tujhe Sab Hain Pata Meri Maa
You know everything my mom


Bheed Mein Yun Na Chodo Mujhe
Please don't leave me like this in the crowd


Ghar Laut Ke Bhi Aa Naa Paun Maa
I won't be able to come back home mom


Bhej Na Itna Door Mujkko Tu
Please, you don't send me so far that


Yaad Bhi Tujhko Aa Naa Paun Maa
You will not even remember me mom


Kya Itna Bura Hoon Main Maa
Mom, am I that bad


Kya Itna Bura Meri Maa
Am I that bad, my mom


Jab Bhi Kabhi Papa Mujhe Jo Zor Se Jhoola Jhulate Hain Maa
Whenever dad pushes me high in the swing


Meri Nazar Dhoondhe Tujhe
My eyes will look for you


Sochu Yahi Tu Aa Ke Thaamegi Maa
Thinking you will come and hold me, mom


Unse Main Yeh Kehta Nahin
I've never told him


Par Main Seham Jaata Hoon Maa
But I do get scared mom


Chehre Pe Aana Deta Nahin
Though I never let it come on my face


Dil Hi Dil Mein Ghabraata Hoon Maa
I am scared within mom


Tujhe Sab Hain Pata Hain Na Maa
Aren't you aware of everything mom


Tujhe Sab Hain Pata Meri Maa
You know everything my mom
